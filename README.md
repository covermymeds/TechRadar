# CMM Platform Technology Radar
A view of our [Technology Radar](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcovermymeds%2FTechRadar%2Fmaster%2FPlatform_Technology_Radar.csv) based upon the work done by Thought Works. (https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)

# RADAR AT A GLANCE
1. ADOPT
* We feel strongly that the industry should be adopting these items. We use them when appropriate on our projects.
2. TRIAL
* Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. Enterprises should try this technology on a project that can handle the risk.
3. ASSESS
* Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect your enterprise.
4. DEPR
* Technologies that we are likely no longer investing in or actively moving away from.

## Shapes indicate status on the Radar
* TRIANGLE = NEW OR CHANGED
* CIRCLE = NO CHANGE 

Items that are new or have had significant changes since the last Radar are represented as triangles, while items that have not changed are represented as circles

Our Radar is generally forward looking. To make room for new items, we fade items that haven’t moved recently, which isn’t a reflection on their value but rather our limited Radar real estate.
